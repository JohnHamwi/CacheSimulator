<!-- INTRODUCTION: Brief introduction about the project, its inspiration, and purpose -->
## Introduction
The Java Cache Simulator is an innovative project that simulates the operations of a cache system using Java. This project showcases the implementation of caching algorithms and data structures, providing a practical example of key computer science concepts. It's an educational tool designed for students and professionals alike, illustrating the principles of cache management and performance optimization.

<!-- DESCRIPTION: Detailed description of the project, its features, and functionalities -->
## Description
This project implements a cache system simulation in Java, featuring a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache algorithm. It reads domain-name/IP address pairs from a file and simulates caching them, providing insights into cache hits, misses, and the efficiency of the LRU strategy. The project includes detailed classes for cache simulation, cache entries, and a simulator to demonstrate real-world applications of caching mechanisms.

<!-- GETTING STARTED: Instructions on setting up and starting the project -->
## Getting Started
To set up and run the Java Cache Simulator:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnhamwi/cachesimulator
cd CacheSimulator
javac src/com/cachesimulator/Simulator.java
java com.cachesimulator.Simulator
```

<!-- EXAMPLES OF USAGE: Examples showing how to use the project -->
##Examples of Usage
Here's a simple example of how to run the Simulator:
```java
// Inside your main method
String fileName = "path/to/datafile.txt"; // Replace with the path to your data file
int cacheSize = 10; // Set the desired cache size
ArrayCache cache = new ArrayCache(cacheSize);
Simulator.simulate(cache, fileName);
Simulator.printStats(cache);
```
